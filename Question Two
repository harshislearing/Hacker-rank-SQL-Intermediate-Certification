Explanation:
The query joins the customer and invoice tables on the customer ID

It groups the results by customer to calculate the total amount each customer spent

The HAVING clause filters for customers whose total spending is â‰¤ 25% of the average invoice amount

The ROUND function formats the amount spent to 6 decimal places

Results are ordered by amount spent from high to low
